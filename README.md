# Customer_Analysis_Project
# Introduction 
  Let's get familier with some basics terms . This Repository contains the data souce (sales_06_FY2020-21.csv.zip)  and the tableau Workbook (Customer Analysis Using Tableau.twbx") used in my Tableau Public
# Descriptive
1) Revenue per State
2) Revenue based on Month of the Year
3) Revenue based on Age
4) Quantity - Discount percetage Correlation
5) Percentage of Revenue per Region
6) Revenue Per Category Per Gender
7) Finally we build a Dashboard
# Data Analysis 
A simple example of data analysis can be seen whenever we make a decision in our daily lives by evaluating what has happened in the past or what will happen if we make that decision. Basically, this is the process of analyzing the past or future and making a decision based on that analysis.
To analyze the data there are 5 steps 
1) Identify business questions
2) Collect and store data
3) Clean and prepare data
4) Analyze data
5) Visualize and communicate data.

# Identify business questions
Many organizations spend millions collecting data of all kinds from different sources, but many fail to create value from it. The truth is that no matter how much data your company owns or how many data scientists comprise the department, data only becomes a game-changer once you have identified the right business questions. 
Identifying the right business questions is crucial to improve efficiency and will eventually save your company time and other resources.
# Collect and store data
First, you need to collect and store your data in a safe place to analyze it.
In our data-driven society, a huge amount of data is generated every second. 
mainly depending on the business questions we aim to answer, different types of data and techniques will be used. Generally, collecting, storing, and analyzing qualitative data requires more advanced methods than quantitative data.
# Clean and prepare data
Once we collected and stored your data, the next step is to assess its quality. It’s important that the success of our data analysis depends on the quality of our data. our insights will be wrong or misleading if our information is inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent. That’s why spending time cleaning and preparing time is mandatory. 
And raw data rarely comes in ready for analysis. This is especially important if you’re dealing with large datasets that consume a lot of memory.
Removing duplicate rows, columns, or cells. 
Removing rows and columns that won’t be needed during analysis. This is especially important if you’re dealing with large datasets that consume a lot of memory. 
Dealing with white spaces in datasets, also known as null values
Managing anomalous and extreme values, also known as outliers
Standardizing data structure and types so that all data is expressed in the same way.
# Analyze Data
Now that your data looks clean, you’re ready to analyze data. Finding patterns, connections, insights, and predictions is often the most satisfying part of the data scientist's work. 
Depending on the goals of the analysis and the type of data, different techniques are available. Over the years, new techniques and methodologies have appeared to deal with all kinds of data. They range from simple linear regressions to advanced techniques from cutting-edge fields, such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.
Some of the most popular data analysis methods are 
# Visualize and communicate data. 
The last step of the data science workflow is visualizing and communicating the results of our data analysis.
As already mentioned, data visualization is the act of translating data into a visual context. This can be done using charts, plots, animations, infographics, and so on. The idea behind it is to make it easier for humans to identify trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
# Dashboard
A Tableau Dashboard is a presentation of multiple data visualizations and insights on one single screen. Tableau Dashboard acts as a one-stop solution to simultaneously monitor a wide range of real-time business intelligence information and make result-oriented decisions.
